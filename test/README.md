# Vertex Functional Tests

Tests will be added here when we have more functionality to test.

We use Poetry for managing the test dependencies.  Make sure you have that
installed along with Python 3.10 or higher.

## Running tests

```
poetry shell
./entry.py
```

The test harness script will be extended with more functionality as we need it.
